## Landing Page Structure

The landing page is organized into seven strategic sections with smooth Framer Motion animations:

1. **Hero** - Video background with staggered text animations
2. **Problem** - Animated cards with glowing hover borders
3. **Solution** - Timeline with phase-by-phase reveals
4. **Difference** - Grid cards with subtle lift effects
5. **Opinion Leadership** - Article cards with scale animations
6. **Social Test** - Testimonial carousel with smooth transitions
7. **Call to Action** - Form with interactive input animations

## Animation Guidelines

- **Smooth & Subtle**: Low movement values (8-20px) with long durations (1.0-1.2s)
- **Consistent Easing**: "easeOut" for all transitions
- **Viewport Triggers**: `once: true` for single-play animations
- **Staggered Effects**: Natural cascading with 0.15s delays
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover and tap micro-interactions

## Development Guidelines

- Follow Standard.js rules
- Use functional components and hooks
- Implement Tailwind for layout and common utilities
- Use Stylus modules for component-specific styles
- Minimize client-side JavaScript with React Server Components
- Use Framer Motion for all animations and transitions
